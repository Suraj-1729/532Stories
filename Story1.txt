As the sun sets over a desolate highway motel, a juice-soaked writer confronts his inner demons in a fevered battle of words, culminating in a midnight showdown that could either save his soul or seal his fate.

 As the sun sinks behind the desolate highway motel, a writer soaked in the intoxication of his own words confronts the demons lurking within. In a fevered battle of words that unfolds under the moon's cold light, a midnight showdown looms, 
 poised on the precipice between salvation and a fate irrevocably sealed.(Mufuttau Ramon)
